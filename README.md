### What is it?

SharpNav is a library that generates and finds paths through navigation meshes. It is functionally equivalent to Mikko Monomen's wonderful [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/memononen/recastnavigation).

SharpNav is proudly an [RCOS](http://rcos.rpi.edu/) project.

### What are the benefits of SharpNav over alternatives?

There are several:
 - **It's portable!** SharpNav is written entirely in C#, so  that the same `SharpNav.dll` will run on all .NET or Mono supported platforms, **no recompilation necessary.**
 - **It's fast!** SharpNav was written with performance in mind and **performs competitively** with Recast.
 - **It's free!** SharpNav is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
 - **It's clean!** SharpNav aims to maintain a **clean and concise public API** that matches that of the Base Class Library. It also strives to maintain clean source code by following style and structure rules enforced by both StyleCop and FxCop.
 - **It's integrated!** SharpNav has compile configurations to integrate with various graphics toolkits and game engines. In the near future, there will be integration with game engine content pipelines as well.

## Usage

SharpNav is both highly configurable and simple to use. If you want to generate a `NavMesh` from a single mesh, it is as simple as the following block of code:

``` CSharp
//prepare the geometry from your mesh data
var tris = TriangleEnumerable.FromIndexedVertices( ... );

//use the default generation settings
var settings = NavMeshGenerationSettings.Default;
settings.AgentHeight = 1.7f;
settings.AgentWidth = 0.6f;

//generate the mesh
var navMesh = NavMesh.Generate(tris, settings);
```

For finer control over the generation process, you can refer to the [Examples](Source/SharpNav.Examples) project.

## Quick Start

### NuGet

SharpNav is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpNav/). It can be installed by issuing the following command in the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package SharpNav
```

There are also NuGet packages for the versions of SharpNav that integrate with other frameworks:

 - [SharpNav.MonoGame](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpNav.MonoGame)
 - [SharpNav.OpenTK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpNav.OpenTK)
 - [SharpNav.SharpDX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpNav.SharpDX)
 
### From Source

SharpNav follows the standard C# project structure. It is actively developed on Windows with Visual Studio 2015 and on Linux and OS X with MonoDevelop, so it should compile just fine in those cases.

Binaries are not output to their project's local `bin` folder, they are all output to the `Binaries` folder in the repository's root directory.

SharpNav can be configured to depend on other libraries. Each one has it's own compile configuration that require at least one extra NuGet package. The way the project is currently structured requires all of the engine integrations' packages to be downloaded regardless of which configuration is selected (this balloons the size of a checked out and built repository to a little over 400MB). Fixing this would be a great contribution if anyone reading this is a MSBuild guru :stuck_out_tongue:
